# speech-emotion-recognizer

I was curious to work with speech synthesis and decided to create a simple model that would recognize the emotion of the speaker. 
I took a and utilized Deepgram https://deepgram.com/ Speech-To-Text API to process the speech, took distillbert-base model, and fine-tuned on emotion data, and
just assembled it all together.
